      question: "What is MBTI?",
      answer: "MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) is a personality assessment that identifies 16 personality types based on four key dichotomies: Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I), Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N), Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P). It helps individuals understand their strengths, decision-making styles, and interactions with others."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the MBTI Petsonality Test work?",
      answer: "The test consists of a series of behavioral questions that assess how your pet interacts with people, environments, and routines. Based on your answers, your pet is classified into one of 16 personality types, providing insights into their social tendencies, problem-solving style, and daily habits."
    },
    {
      question: "Can pets really have personality types like humans?",
      answer: "While pets don't think the way humans do, they show distinct patterns in how they interact, learn, and react to their surroundings. Some are naturally curious and eager to explore, while others prefer familiarity and routine. This test doesn't assign deep psychology to pets but instead helps identify their behavioral tendencies in a way that makes sense to owners."
    },
    {
      question: "How can this test help me as a pet owner?",
      answer: "This test is a fun way to see the world through your pet's eyes. Maybe your dog is a social butterfly, always ready to greet new friends, or your cat is an independent observer, happiest in their own space. Some pets thrive on routine, while others embrace spontaneity.\nUnderstanding their personality can make training easier, playtime more enjoyable, and your bond even stronger. It's a simple way to appreciate what makes your fluffy angle unique and create a life that suits them perfectly."
